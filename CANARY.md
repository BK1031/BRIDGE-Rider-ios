## Canary Application Requirements



## Creating Issue/Feature Requests

The best way to provide contructive feedback is through GitHub itself. Create a new issue on the [Issue Tab](https://github.com/BK1031/BRIDGE-Rider-ios/issues). Then specify whether you are adding a bug, or requesting a new feature enhancement. Follow the guidelines below:

**Bugs:**
- Include what version of the app you are using, either through the commit id, or the TestFlight Version.
- Give a description of what the bug is (e.g. what went wrong). Please be as descriptive as possible
- Explain the steps you took that led to the bug. This will help us to recreate the bug and take steps to fix it

**Enhancements:**
- Give a description of the enhancement that you are requesting. What does it do? Why do we need it? Be as descriptive as possible.

Make sure to add additional labels based on what you are asking for. For example, if you are requesting a new feature that automatically selects the destination, then add the "Enhancement" label as well as the "Ride Request Algorithm" label.

After you are done, make sure to add the issue to the respective Project Board for the repository that you are on.
